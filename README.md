# jenkins-seed
This is the Repo my automatic Deployment of Jenkins uses to import jobs.
Each Job that needs to be imported can be added by simply copying the groovy script, and putting in the right github url. It can import many jobs at the same time. 
Fully automatic, and without any setup required. Webhook can be added to automaticly add new jobs when they are added in this repo. 
This way you don't have to touch jenkins, and still get all your jobs imported.
